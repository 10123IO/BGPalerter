############################
# Notification settings:
# - notificationIntervalSeconds
#       Defines the amount of seconds after which an alert can be repeated. An alert is repeated only if the event that
#       triggered it is not yet solved. Please, don't set this value to Infinity, use instead alertOnlyOnce.
#
# - alertOnlyOnce - A boolean that, if set to true, will prevent repetitions of the same alert even if the event that
#       triggered it is not yet solved. In this case notificationIntervalSeconds will be ignored.
#       If set to true, the signature of all alerts will be cached in order to recognize if they already happened in
#       the past. This may lead to a memory leak if the amount of alerts is considerable.
